 -----------1.Programming Approach-------------
------Procedural Programming:--------
Focuses on functions (procedures) and sequence of tasks to be performed. It follows a top-down approach.


----------Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):-----------
Focuses on objects (instances of classes) and data encapsulation. It follows a bottom-up approach.



 --------------2. Structure-----------------------
a.Procedural:
Code is organized into functions. Data and behavior are separate.

b.OOP:
Code is organized into classes and objects, combining data and behavior together.




---------------- 3. Reusability--------------
Procedural:
Code reuse is limited; functions can be reused but not easily extended.

OOP:
Promotes high reusability through inheritance, polymorphism, and composition.




------------4. Data Handling-------------
Procedural:
Data is usually global or shared, and functions operate on it. Thereâ€™s less protection.

OOP:
Data is encapsulated within objects. Access is controlled using access modifiers (like private, protected, public).




------------Defination---------------
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing code where you build programs using "objects." These objects represent real things, like a car or a person, and they have both data (like color or name) and actions (like drive or talk). It helps make code easier to organize, understand, and reuse.
