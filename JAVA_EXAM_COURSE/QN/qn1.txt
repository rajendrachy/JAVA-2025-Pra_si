 Code:
java
Copy
Edit
class Car {
    String model;
}


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car c = null;
        System.out.println(c.model);
    }
}
❓ What is the output?
java
Copy
Edit
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
❗ Why does this happen?
You declared Car c = null;
→ This means the reference c does not point to any Car object — it’s null.

Then you tried to access c.model
→ Java tries to access a field (model) of a null object, which leads to a NullPointerException.
