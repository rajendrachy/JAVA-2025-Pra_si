------------In Java, variables declared inside an interface are by default:---------
a.public – accessible from anywhere.
b.static – belong to the interface itself, not to any instance.
c.final – must be assigned a value at declaration and cannot be changed later.





------------In Java, methods declared inside an interface (before Java 8) are by default:-----------
a.public – accessible from anywhere.
b.abstract – must be implemented by the class that implements the interface.

Java Coding Activity – Fuel Station Billing System
Question Statement:
You are required to design and implement a simple fuel station billing system using
Java interfaces and classes.
The objective is to demonstrate the use of interfaces, constants, and polymorphism
in calculating fuel bills for different types of vehicles.
What is Given to the You:
You are provided with a FuelStation interface. This interface contains:
1. Constants for fuel price per litre for different vehicle types:
double PETROL_PRICE = 105.5;
double DIESEL_PRICE = 92.3;
double CNG_PRICE = 78.9;
2. Abstract Methods:
1. void fillFuel(String vehicleNumber, double litres);
2. double calcBill(double litres);
What to Implement:
1. Create three classes — PetrolVehicle, DieselVehicle, and CNGVehicle — that
implement the FuelStation interface.
2. In each class:
o Implement the fillFuel method to display a message confirming the fuel
type and quantity filled for that vehicle.
o Implement the calcBill method to calculate the total bill using the
relevant fuel price constant from the interface.
3. Create a BillingCounter class that contains a method generateBill.
4. The generateBill method should accept:
o A FuelStation object (any vehicle type)
o The vehicle number
o The litres of fuel filled
5. Inside generateBill:
o Call fillFuel to display the fuel filling message.
o Call calcBill to display the calculated bill amount.
Method Signature in BillingCounter Class:
public void generateBill(FuelStation f, String vehicleNumber, double litres)
Sample Output Example:
Filling 20.0 litres of Petrol for vehicle HP12AB1234.
Total Bill: ₹2110.0
Filling 15.0 litres of Diesel for vehicle PB10CD5678.
Total Bill: ₹1384.5
Filling 10.0 litres of CNG for vehicle CH01EF4321.
Total Bill: ₹789.0
