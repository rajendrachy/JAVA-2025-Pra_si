------------this() and super() in java-------------
ans:- this() and super() both are special in terms of constructors. 

=> this() is used to call another constructor of same class. 
=> super() is used to call a constructor of super class.


class AreaObject 
{
	double x, y, width, height;
	public AreaObject(double x, double y, double width, double height) 
	{
	this.x = x;
	this.y = y;
	this.width = width;
	this.height = height;
	}
	public AreaObject(double x, double y) 
	{
		this(x,y,10,10); // calls main constructor with default size
	}
	public AreaObject() 
	{
		this(1,1); // calls above constructor with default position
	}
}

this() is used to call another constructor in the same class.
This is called constructor chaining.
