If you write the following code in Java:

java
Copy
Edit
int a;
System.out.println(a);
❌ You will get a compile-time error.
🔎 Why?
In Java, local variables (like a in this case) must be initialized before use.

Even though a is declared, it has no value assigned, and Java does not assign a default value to local variables.
