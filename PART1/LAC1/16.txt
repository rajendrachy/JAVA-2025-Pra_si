In Java programming, "robust" refers to the language's ability to handle errors and unexpected situations gracefully without crashing. It's one of Java's key design principles.

------------Key features that make Java robust:---------------
a.Strong memory management
Java has automatic garbage collection, which helps prevent memory leaks.

b.Exception handling
Java forces developers to handle errors using try, catch, and finally blocks, reducing the risk of unexpected crashes.

c.Type checking
Java is a statically typed language with strong type checking at compile time, which helps catch errors early.

d.Lack of pointers
Java does not allow direct access to memory using pointers, making the program more secure and less prone to errors.
